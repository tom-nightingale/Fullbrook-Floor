2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** page in WordPress

4. To allow your website to post to Google My Business on your behalf, click **Connect to Google My Business**. Confirm the authorization using the Google account that holds your business location.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin on a localhost installation? =

Yes, but you may run into errors if you add a link or image to your post. Google will try to fetch your image/video, or resolve the link to your website, but if your localhost installation can't be reached from the outside world, it won't be able to do so.
The quick post feature will not work at all in that case, because it uses the URL and Featured Image of your post.

= Why is/are my location(s) grayed out? =

Not every Google My Business listing is allowed to create posts on Google My Business (localPostAPI is disabled). This means the plugin can't create posts on those locations. First, make sure your location is fully verified & live. Business chains (10+ locations) are normally exempt from creating posts, but are temporarily allowed to create them to share updates about the corona virus.

= Why are my scheduled posts being published too late/not at all? =

Post to Google My Business relies on the WP Cron system to send out scheduled posts. By default, it is only triggered when someone visits your website. If your site doesn't get a lot of visitors, your posts may be sent out too late. To make the WP Cron system more dependable, you can [hook it into the system task scheduler](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/hooking-wp-cron-into-the-system-task-scheduler/)
