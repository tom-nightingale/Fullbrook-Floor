###üîë HOW DOES MULTI-STEP FORM WORKS?

This Multi-Step plugin extends the Contact Form 7 functionality. After activating, you can start adding a new tab as a new step to your form. You can also have many multi step forms on the same website. 
Check out [documentation here](https://ninjateam.org/contact-form-7-multi-step-pro-doc/).

With Multi-Step Pro, form steps can have their own titles, custom **Back** and **Next** buttons, animation effects, and more:

- **Progress bar** (Pro): show numbered steps, various pre-built design options, percentage display
- **Show input** (Pro): add this new tag to help display input data in the previous fields and steps
- **Preview button** (Pro): insert a button to allow your visitors to double-check their submitted data before sending the form
- **Choose step** (Pro): let the audience choose a particular step to complete first

Happy Form Building! üß°
